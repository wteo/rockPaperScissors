# About

This is the first project I completed to learn and understand the basics of DOM and DOM events. 

Rules of the game are simple.
1. Paper beats rock;
2. Rock beats scissors; and
3. Scissors beats Paper.
If you, the player, chooses the same element as the AI (i.e Paper vs Paper, Rock vs Rock), both you and AI are tied. 

To restart the game, simply refresh the web page.

There is no complicated algorithm here. The choice the AI makes will always be random, with 33.33% for every available choice.
